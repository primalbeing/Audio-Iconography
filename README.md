# Audio Iconography (In Progress)

Audio Iconography is a minimal Android app designed to detect wired headphones and display an icon in the status bar. It was created for a specific use case as a personal project and as a favour to a friend. While it works in some scenarios, it is still in development and has many bugs, compatibility issues, and incomplete features.

## Development Status

At this stage, testing is limited, and the app may behave differently across devices, especially those with background service restrictions such as Android 12+. The goal is to make it a lightweight, battery-efficient solution that operates seamlessly without unnecessary notifications or popups.

The app has been released as a **pre-release version**, meaning the APK is harder to find. If you want to download it, check the **Releases** section of this repository on GitHub.

## Features (In Progress)

- Persistent notification when wired headphones are connected.
- Automatic detection of headphone state.
- Low battery usage by avoiding unnecessary background processes.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- The notification does not always update correctly when unplugging headphones.
- Android 12+ restrictions may require additional permissions.
- The app has not been tested extensively across different devices (best compatibility is with Android 10+).
- No UI customization is available yet; it is strictly function-based.

## Why This App Exists

This project started as a simple tool for a specific need. Many existing apps either had too many unnecessary features, were poorly optimized and consumed battery, or required unwanted permissions. 

Since I was already working on Android development, I decided to build this from scratch as a favour for a friend who wanted something cleaner and more efficient. The project turned out to be more complex than expected, so please contribute or assist me in any way you can.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions because this project is more work than I initially anticipated. If you are interested in helping:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Submit a pull request with improvements.
3. Open an issue if you find a bug or have a feature suggestion.

Bug fixes, improvements to detection logic, UI refinements, and better device compatibility are especially needed.
