# 🎧 Audio Iconography (Beta)
_A minimal Android app for detecting wired headphones and displaying an icon in the status bar._

## 🚧 Development Status  
This app is **still in development** and **may not always work as expected**. It was built to **fit a specific use case** as a personal project and as a favour to a friend. While it works in some scenarios, there are still a lot of **bugs, compatibility issues, and incomplete features**.

At this stage, **testing is limited**, and the app may behave differently across devices due to their restrictions on background services. The goal is to make it a **lightweight, battery-efficient solution** that just works without unnecessary notifications or popups.

## 🔍 Features (In Progress)
- **Persistent notification** when wired headphones are connected.
- **Automatic detection** of headphone state.
- **No unnecessary battery drain** (keeps CPU & background usage minimal).

## 🛠️ Known Issues & Limitations
- **Notification may not always update correctly** when unplugging headphones.
- **Android 12+ restrictions** may require additional permissions.
- **Not heavily tested on different devices** (works best on Android 10+).
- **No UI customization yet** (strictly function-based).

## 🏗️ Why This App Exists  
This project started as a **simple tool for a personal use case**, where existing apps either:
- Had **too many unnecessary features**.
- Were **poorly optimized** or consumed battery.
- Required **unwanted permissions**.

Since I was already working on Android development, I decided to **build it from scratch** as a **favour for a friend** who wanted something **simpler and cleaner**. The app is now at an **alpha stage**, and improvements are ongoing.
